# rebook

rebook is a Tcl/Tk based GUI for the PDF conversion tool, k2pdfopt.

rebook depends on python3 and Tcl/Tk 8.6. Tck/Tk with version lower than 8.6 doesn't work.

To check if the dependencies are correctly installed, just run `python3 -m tkinter`.

To run rebook, put k2pdfopt binary and rebook.py under the same directory and run `python3 rebook.py`

rebook is still under developing, feel free to report any issue.
